ABOUT WORDLE -
Wordle is a logic-based word puzzle where your goal is to identify a secret five-letter word within a set number of attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback through three colored
signals: green indicates a letter is correct and in the right position, yellow means the letter is in the word but currently in the wrong spot, and gray or black means the letter does not appear in 
the word at all. To play effectively, you must use these clues to narrow down possibilities, eliminating incorrect letters and repositioning correct ones until the exact word is revealed.
